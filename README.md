CLUE Step Counter with ST LSM6DS33

https://learn.adafruit.com/clue-step-counter-st-lsm6ds33

For walking meditation it is helpful to know how many steps you made during an activity as accurately as possible. I had big problems with Garmin devices, since Garmin does not allow to access to number of steps done during an activity in Garmin connect anymore. Steps have to be calculated manually from Garmin Connect data, which is not very comfortable. There should be a way to read out the number of steps done during an activity from the CLUE step counter by a PC application. Adafruid has several Android apps for their circuit devices.

I could not find an option to stream sensor data further to PC applications in the Adafruit apps, but many circuits of Adafruitare are Arduino compatible. Arduinos can be connected over usb to Matlab or Python.
